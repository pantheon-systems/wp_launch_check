WP Launch Check is an extension for WP-CLI designed for Pantheon.io customers. While designed initially for the Pantheon dashboard it is intended to be fully usable outside of Pantheon. 

To use WP Launch Check simply run the ```wp launchcheck <subcommand>``` command like you would any other WP-CLI command.

For more information about WP-CLI you can visit [their github page](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli). 

WP Launch Check should be considered in "BETA". Many of the checks have still not been tested in the wild. If you experience a problem please open an issue.
